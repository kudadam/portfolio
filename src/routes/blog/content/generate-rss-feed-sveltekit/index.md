Before I knew about RSS (Really Simple Syndicate), this was how I used to stay updated with my favourite websites. I will bookmark the website, then everyone once in a while, I will go to the website and see if they have posted new content. Well I knowðŸ˜‚, this was really tiring because I always needed to check up on the websites once in a while.

Fast forward, I came to learn about RSS and it's what I've been using since. Currently, I use the [Inoreader app](inoreader.com). With it, I organize all my favourite feeds and whenever any of them updates their content, I get a notification. I'm not going to dive into how RSS works, I do believe you know how it works and we are going to look at how to incorporate it into our SvelteKit website.

## Basic structure of an RSS feed 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">

<channel>
  <title>Website name</title>
  <link>https://www.example.com</link>
  <description>A nice description of your website</description>
  <item>
    <title>blog post 1</title>
    <link>https://www.example.com/link/to/blog/1</link>
    <description>A description about the article</description>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>blog post 2</title>
    <link>https://www.example.com/link/to/blog/2</link>
    <description>A description about the article</description>
  </item>
</channel>

</rss>
```

The code above is the basic structure of an RSS feed. It's written in XML, a markup language just like HTML. It's tags contain the necessary information needed by RSS readers to understand the contents published. Now, let's go over the tags

| Tag name              | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| channel               | This is a container tag. <br />It contains three required tags that describe the feed. |
| channel > title       | This refers to the name of the channel. An example is 'Kudadam Blog' |
| channel >  link       | This is a link to the website which is providing the feed. A valid example is the URL to your website |
| channel > description | A general description of the channel                         |
| item                  | The item tag is also another container tag. It's contents talk about a single idea. An example is a blog post |
| item > title          | The title of your article or blog post                       |
| item > link           | The URL to your article or blog post                         |
| item > description    | The description about your blog post. Some prefer to include the encoded version of the blog posts whiles other prefer to give a summary to the blog post over here. <br />If you're embedding the html over here, you must properly encode it. |
| item > category       | If you categorize your articles, you can include the category here (optional) |
| item > pubDate        | The date the article was published                           |

The table above shows a list of the possible tags we can use to make a simple RSS feed, if you want more features, you can go ahead and [find valid tags over here](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html).

## Implementing it in SvelteKit

Now we have seen how to structure our RSS feed, we can then move on to implement it in our SvelteKit website. Most websites have their feed on this URL https://www.example.com/feed.xml or https://www.example.com/rss. I think this version (https://www.example.com/feed.xml) looks cool or depending on your choice, you can choose any.

In your `src/routes/` folder, create a folder whose name will be the path to your RSS feed. Since, I'm creating the feed for my blog, this is how I will place my folder, `src/routes/blog/feed.xml` where the `feed.xml` is the folder which is going to contain the RSS feed.  Inside the folder, create a server endpoint file (`+server.js`). The reason why we are using a `+server.js` file is that, we want to have full control of the response, this is because we aren't going to return html but xml.

So this is how I created my endpoint, explanations are below.

```javascript

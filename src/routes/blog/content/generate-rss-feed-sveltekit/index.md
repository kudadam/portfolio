Adding an RSS feed to your website is an excellent way to notify readers when new blog posts are published.
After learning about the importance of RSS feeds, I decided to add one to the blog section of my website. All the user has to do is subscribe, and they will be notified when new blog posts are made.

## Creating the File

Now, you need to create the file wherever you want the RSS feed to appear. Inside my `src/routes/blog` directory, I made a folder called "feed.xml". Take note of the folder name. Inside the folder that you created, place a `+server.js` file; this is the file that will return the contents.

## Writing the code

Paste the following code inside your `+server.js` file.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Array<any>} files
 * @returns {Promise<string>}
 */
const sort_items = async (files) => {
	let rss = ``;
	files.forEach((post) => {
		rss += `
<item>
	<title>${post.title}</title>
	<link>https://www.kudadam.com/blog/${post.slug}</link>
	<description>${encodeHtml(post.html)}</description>
	<category>${post.category}</category>
	<guid>https://www.kudadam.com/blog/${post.slug}</guid>
	<pubDate>${new Date(post.date)}</pubDate>
</item>`;
	});

	return rss;
};

/**@type {import("./$types").RequestHandler} */
export const GET = async () => {
	const files = await getFilesHtml();
	let sorted = sort_items(files);
	let rss = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">
	<channel>
		<title>Kudadam Blog</title>
		<link>https://wwww.kudadam.com/blog</link>
		<language>en-us</language>

		${await sorted}

	</channel>
</rss>`;
	return new Response(rss, {
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": "application/xml"
		}
	});
};
```

## Explaining the code

The code above is the one I use for my website; I will explain how it works so you can adopt a similar approach when making your RSS feed.
So, as we all know in Sveltekit, the `GET` function handles all "get" requests to the path. First, I get a json file containing metadata for all of the blog posts. I then assign it to a constant `files`. Then I pass the object from the `files` constant into a function called `sort_items`; this function takes the files and returns an RSS equivalent of them.
Finally, I create a template literal and insert the contents of the `sort_items` function. We then return a new response with its headerâ€™s content type as "application/xml".
